Thinkorswim scripts


The only true and unambiguous indicator of why the market is moving and what it will do next is volume.

These custom scripts are intended to give a realtime view into how volume is evolving during the trading day.

They do have some overlap between eachother so you may opt for one over the other

I am still backtesting realTimeVolume to see if we can use the over bought and over sold regions as sell or buy indicators

**Do your own testing and rely on your edge/strategy for trading. These scripts are just telling you what volume is doing, nothing else, it is up to you to use your brain to decide how to use the information to guide your trades.**

To install these scripts, the process is the same.

To add these scripts, you will need to click the "Beaker" icon in the top bar on any of your charts.

From there, a new window pops up. Hit the "Create" button

Delete the " plot Data = close" line

Then copy all of the code, to ##the end and paste it in this window. 

Rename your file whatever you want where it says "New Study"

Hit the Green "OK" button in the bottom right corner.

And you're done, your script is loaded and ready to use!
Do the same for each script you want to add to your toolbox.
